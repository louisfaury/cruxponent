I am a machine learning researcher. I used to work on bandits -- my PhD topic. I now focus on dynamical systems, control and reinforcement learning. 

I learn better when writing things down, as if I was preparing lectures notes for myself.
I archive the result on this blog - hopefully, it can be helpful to others.
